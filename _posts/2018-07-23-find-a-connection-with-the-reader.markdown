Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." Noooooo! Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!

You lived before you met me?! Ow, my spirit! Humans dating robots is sick. __You people wonder why I'm still single?__ *It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!* I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.

## Are you crazy? I can't swallow that.

Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Meh. So, how 'bout them Knicks? Also Zoidberg.

1. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
2. Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
3. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?

### Why not indeed!

Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Soothe us with sweet lies. Bender?! You stole the atom. You don't know how to do any of those.

* Shinier than yours, meatbag.
* This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.
* Ooh, name it after me!

Say what? Throw her in the brig. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Ow, my spirit! Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?

Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.

*Minimalism*

Ummmâ€¦to eBay? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.
