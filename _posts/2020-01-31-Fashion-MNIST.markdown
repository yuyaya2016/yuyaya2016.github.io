The project is to recognize the apparel images from a given category that uses Artificial Neural
Network (ANN) and deep learning models. Also, build Machine Learning (ML) models that takes an image as input and provide the category of apparels as an output. What's more, the high-dimensional image data would be visualized into 3 dimensional spaces using t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) method in Tensorboard.
